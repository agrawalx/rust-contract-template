# 🧠 STARK Verification on Polkadot using PolkaVM

## Overview

This project proves that it's now possible to build **end-to-end DApps** that:

>🧩 **Put complex computation in Rust contracts** (e.g., ZK proof verification, cryptography)
>⚙️ **Use Solidity to handle business logic, user interactions, and token flow**

Thanks to __PolkaVM__, which enables high-performance Rust smart contracts running in a `no_std` **RISC-V** environment, and **AssetHub**, which lets these contracts interoperate directly with Solidity.

As a practical demo, this project verifies a **STARK proof for a linear regression computation**, generated with **Winterfell**, directly on-chain.

## 🔥 What This Project Enables
- ✅ Complex logic like STARK verification in no_std Rust contracts

- ✅ Business logic, user access control, and payments via Solidity

- ✅ A fully integrated dual-runtime DApp using AssetHub

- ✅ On-chain **Merkle verification, Blake3 hashing, and custom finite field math**

- ✅ Real-world demo: verifying a linear regression STARK proof

## 📐 Use Case: Linear Regression STARK Proof
As a proof-of-concept, this project shows how you can:

- Train a linear regression model off-chain

- Prove that computation using a STARK proof

- Verify that proof entirely on-chain, in a RISC-V smart contract

- Let Solidity contracts trigger the verification and handle outcomes

- This approach is ideal for verifiable compute, ML inference, or ZK analytics.

## This architecture allows a clean separation of roles:

- Rust handles cryptographic computation and ZK logic

- Solidity manages DApp logic, users, tokens, and payouts

## 🧠 Using Winterfell
We use Winterfell off-chain to:

- Define AIR constraints for linear regression

- Generate a STARK proof

- Serialize proof and public inputs with bincode

- Winterfell's verifier cannot run on-chain due to std dependencies, so we re-implement the verifier manually in Rust inside a no_std contract.

## ⚠️ For this demo:

The public inputs are hardcoded into the Rust verifier contract(there were problems in deserializing using bincode as it did not support no_std environment. we have planned to implement a custom deserializer to fix this)

The proof is deserialized on-chain using Winterfell-compatible layout 

## 🧩 From Hardcoded to General-Purpose STARK Verifier
While this demo uses hardcoded public inputs for simplicity, once generalized deserialization is implemented in the Rust verifier contract (handling input formats):
✅ This framework can become a universal on-chain STARK verifier for any AIR program.

## That means you’ll be able to:

- Upload and verify any kind of STARK proof (ML, fraud proofs, off-chain analytics, etc.)

- Keep all business logic in Solidity — rewards, access, asset transfers, etc.

- Build full DApps where Rust handles heavy computation, and Solidity handles everything else

- This unlocks a huge range of use cases, including ZK gaming, verifiable oracles, proof-of-compute systems, and modular AI inference on-chain — all powered by PolkaVM + AssetHub.
